# Applied Machine Learning - Getting Started

# Course Overview

&gt; The session will step through the process of building, visualizing, testing and comparing models that are focused on prediction. The goal of the course is to provide a thorough workflow in R that can be used with many different regression or classification techniques. Case studies are used to illustrate functionality.

&gt; _Basic familiarity with R is required._

The *goal* is for you to be able to easily build predictive/machine learning models in R using a variety of packages and model types. 

* "Models that are focused on prediction"... what does that mean?

* "Machine Learning"... so this is deep learning with massive data sets, right? 

The course is broken up into sections for _regression_ (predicting a numeric outcome) and _classification_ (predicting a category).

# Why R for Modeling?

.pull-left[
* _R has cutting edge models_. Machine learning developers in some domains use R as their primary computing environment and their work often results in R packages.


* _It is easy to port or link to other applications_. R doesn't try to be everything to everyone. If you prefer models implemented in C, C++, `tensorflow`, `keras`, `python`, `stan`, or `Weka`, you can access these applications without leaving R. 
]

.pull-right[
* _R and R packages are built by people who **do** data analysis_. 

* _The S language is very mature_. 

* The machine learning environment in R is extremely rich.

# Downsides to Modeling in R


.pull-left[
* R is a data analysis language and is not C or Java. If a high performance deployment is required, R can be treated like a prototyping language.  

* R is mostly memory-bound. There are plenty of exceptions to this though. 
]

.pull-right[
The main issue is one of _consistency of interface_. For example: 
* There are two methods for specifying what terms are in a model&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Not all models have both. 

* 99% of model functions automatically generate dummy variables. 

* Sparse matrices can be used unless the can't. 

* A more egregious example is code consistency (next slide)

# Syntax for Computing Predicted Class Probabilities

|Function     |Package      |Code                                       |
|:------------|:------------|:------------------------------------------|
|`lda`        |`MASS`       |`predict(obj)`                             |
|`glm`        |`stats`      |`predict(obj, type = "response")`          |
|`gbm`        |`gbm`        |`predict(obj, type = "response", n.trees)` |
|`mda`        |`mda`        |`predict(obj, type = "posterior")`         |
|`rpart`      |`rpart`      |`predict(obj, type = "prob")`              |
|`Weka`       |`RWeka`      |`predict(obj, type = "probability")`       |
|`logitboost` |`LogitBoost` |`predict(obj, type = "raw", nIter)`        |

We'll see a solution for this later in the class.

# Different Philosophies Used Here

There are two main philosophies to data analysis code that will be discussed in this worksop: 

.pull-left[
The _tidy modeling_ approach espouses the tenets of the [tidyverse](http://www.tidyverse.org/): 
1. Reuse existing data structures.
1. Compose simple functions with the pipe.
1. Embrace functional programming.
1. Design for humans.

This approach is exemplified by packages such as [`modelr`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=modelr
), [`broom`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=broom
), [`recipes`](https://topepo.github.io/recipes/), and [`rsample`](https://topepo.github.io/rsample/). 
]

.pull-left[
The more _traditional approach_ uses high-level syntax and is perhaps the most untidy code that you will encounter. 

[`caret`](https://topepo.github.io/caret) is the primary package for untidy predictive modeling: 
1. More traditional R coding style.
1. High-level "I'll do that for you" syntax.
1. More comprehensive (for now) and less modular.
1. Contains many optimizations and is easily parallelized.

# Example Data Set - Regression

For regression problems, we will use the Ames IA housing data. There are 2,930 properties in the data. 

The sale price was recorded along with 81 predictors, including:

* Location (e.g. neighborhood) and lot information.
* House components (garage, fireplace, pool, porch, etc.).
* General assessments such as overall quality and condition.
* Number of bedrooms, baths, and so on. 

More details can be found in [De Cock (2011, Journal of Statistics Education)](http://ww2.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n3/decock.pdf).

The raw data are at [`http://bit.ly/2whgsQM`](http://bit.ly/2whgsQM) but we will use a processed version found in the [`AmesHousing`](https://github.com/topepo/AmesHousing) package.

# Example Data Set - Classification

OkCupid is an online data site that serves international users. [Kim and Escobedo-Land (2015, Journal of Statistics Education)](http://ww2.amstat.org/publications/jse/v23n2/kim.pdf) describe a data set where over 50,000 profiles from the San Fransisco area were made available by the company. 

The data contains several types of fields:

* a number of open text essays related to interests and personal descriptions 
* single choice type fields, such as profession, diet, gender, body type, etc.
* multiple choice data, including languages spoken, etc.
* ***no*** usernames or pictures were included. 

We will try to predict whether someone has a profession in the STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and math) using a random sample of the overall dataset.

# Tidyverse Syntax

Many tidyverse functions have syntax unlike base R code. For example:

* vectors of variable names are eschewed in favor of _functional programming_. For example: 


```r
contains("Sepal")

# instead of 

c("Sepal.Width", "Sepal.Length")
```

* The _pipe_ operator is preferred. For example


```r
merged &lt;- inner_join(a, b)

# is equal to

merged &lt;- a %&gt;%
  inner_join(b) 
```

* Functions are more _modular_ than their traditional analogs

# Some Example Data Manipulation Code


```r
library(tidyverse)

ames &lt;- 
  read_delim("http://bit.ly/2whgsQM", delim = "\t") %&gt;%
  rename_at(vars(contains(' ')), funs(gsub(' ', '_', .))) %&gt;%
  rename(Sale_Price = SalePrice) %&gt;%
  filter(!is.na(Electrical)) %&gt;%
  select(-Order, -PID, -Garage_Yr_Blt)

ames %&gt;%
  group_by(Alley) %&gt;%
  summarize(mean_price = mean(Sale_Price/1000),
            n = sum(!is.na(Sale_Price)))
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 3
##   Alley mean_price     n
##   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;
## 1  Grvl   123.5569   120
## 2  Pave   176.9454    78
## 3  &lt;NA&gt;   183.4260  2731

# Quick Data Investigation

To get warmed up, let's load the Ames data and do some basic investigations into the variables, such as exploratory visualizations or summary statistics. The idea is to get a feel for the data. 

Take a look at the slip of paper with the course information. On the back are a list of variables in the data set that you should focus on. There are different lists in the class. 

Let's take 10 minutes to work on your own or with someone next to you. Collaboration is highly encouraged!

To get the data:


```r
library(AmesHousing)
ames &lt;- make_ames()
```
